# Preliminary notes

I think of each blog post as a news release or a story. About each piece of news, a good news reporter would answer these five questions:

- Why
- Who
- Where
- What
- How

I use these questions as a starting point to write each coral-blog.

Beware of the tense of each post. Write each post as if it was written at the time. Past tense will be used if required, but the present tense of each post is the past of today. This should not be notable.



# Blog 1: the coral team kicks-off!

As in every story, present the actors first. 



### Focus on the project

- Why, because we know little about how humans impact coral reefs ecosystems...```R Recycle text from applications to STF, from website, from other applications that I and Aaron wrote (e.g. drone proposal, etc.).```

- Who, we examined reef corals

- Where,  bocas

- What, specifically, we studied changes in what type of corals and how much of them lived before and since human impacts. 
    
- How, samples had been collected of corals from reefs from two time intervals, one from reefs that lived ~ 7 000 years ago and another one from subrecent



### Focus on the people

- why, because of his scientific and personal attributes, Aaron is one if not best person to work on historical ecology in the Holocene.

- who, I have a fantastic team, including Aaron and the paleolab (link), Andrew (link) Nicte, Melisa.```R Link this blog to whatever website each persons used to advertise themselves.```


- where, stri, panama

- when, The project started three years, two continents, and a number of countries after I met Aaron for the first time...First, I met Aaron in 2013. It was in Australia, at the biggest international conference for coral reef studies, ICRS ... Carins if beautiful ...The second time I met Aaron was in Argentina, at another conference .... Mendoza is beautiful...

- what, what Aaron is interested on is, generally, in understanding ([Change and variation in tropical seas](https://aaronodea.wordpress.com/research-group/)) and, specifically, in answering ([What did reefs look like before humans](https://baselinecaribbean.wordpress.com/)).

- how, 

    + Aaron and his team, Andrew, Nicte and Melisa was exceptionally good... 
    + The lab was vibrant...
    + Nicte and Melisa joined with perfect timing. They were fantastic, innovative, enthusiastic...
    + The job was exciting and

# Blog 3: middle of the story

- Results are final
- A manuscript is being produced
- We plan present the results at the STRI's fellows conference
- Invitation to Berkley to discuss paleoecological data analysis

- Where to from here (people)
    + Nicte got a job in Bocas and submitted her masters thesis
    + Melisa went back to school, full of new skills and ideas
    + Expect to come back t STRI
