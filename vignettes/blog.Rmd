# Issues to built a vignette

## Stystem's time zone

I think that one reason why a vignette failed to build was becasue I had not set the system's time zone, which I finally did with ` Sys.setenv(TZ='GMT')`. This is important, I think, because vignettes build with devtools::use_vignette have the field `date: Sys.Date()`.

## Vignette builder

Vignettes are not built by many proceces (see [A note to devtools users](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/vignette/)). Functions that do build vignettes are, for example:

- `devtools::build_vignettes()`

- `devtools::install(build_vignettes = TRUE)`

- `devtools::install_github("username/repo", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

## Accesing vignettes

To access a vignete run `vignette("vignette-title")` with no other argument (no need to specify the package, as all vignettes seem to be in a same index).




# Preliminary notes

I think of each blog post as a news release or a story. About each piece of news, a good news reporter would answer these five questions:

- Why
- Who
- Where
- What
- How

I use these questions as a starting point to write each coral-blog.

Beware of the tense of each post. Write each post as if it was written at the time. Past tense will be used if required, but the present tense of each post is the past of today. This should not be notable.



# Blog 1: biginning of the story

```R
Re-write in present tense.
```


## Why

```R
Recycle text from applications to STF, from website, from other applications that I and Aaron wrote (e.g. drone proposal, etc.).
```

Because we know little how humans impact coral reefs over the long term....



## Who

```R
Link this blog to whatever website each persons used to advertise themselves.
```

Actors include: Mauro, Aaron and the paleolab (link), Andrew (link) Nicte, Melisa.




## Where and when

The project started three years, two continents, and a number of countries after I met Aaron for the first time...

First, I met Aaron in 2013. It was in Australia, at the biggest international conference for coral reef studies, ICRS ... Carins if beautiful ...

The second time I met Aaron was in Argentina, at another conference .... Mendoza is beautiful...

Finally I arrived at STRI and the project started...



## What

What I did was to gather information from Aaron and from the dataset to identify what samples could answer the research question I have. 

What is the research question?

To allign it with the baseline caribbean

Keep in mind the central themes of the O'Dea lab ([Change and variation in tropical seas](https://aaronodea.wordpress.com/research-group/)) and of the Baseline Caribbean Project ([What did reefs look like before humans](https://baselinecaribbean.wordpress.com/)).



## How

Aaron and his team, Andrew, Nicte and Melisa was exceptionally good... 

The lab was vibrant...

Nicte and Melisa joined with perfect timing. They were fantastic, innovative, enthusiastic...

The job was exciting and
