# Preliminary notes

Blog posts compare to news releases. About each piece of news, a good reporter would answer:

- Why
- Who
- Where
- What
- How

Beware of the tense of each post. Write each post as if it was written at the time.

# Blog 1: the coral team kicks-off!

```R As in every story, present the actors first.```

What did reefs look like before humans?. `why `To answer this question, `Where ` I joined the [Baseline Caribbean project](https://baselinecaribbean.wordpress.com/) of the [O'Dea lab](https://aaronodea.wordpress.com/research-group/).

`who `Reef corals, in particular, are very important. For example, they build "homes" for multiple reef ctitters---including fish we eat. Reefs also protect our coasts against storms and boost the tourisms industry. `need `Despite their importance, little we know about how reefs vary naturally and how they respond to human impact. `why `To lean more and thus help conserve coral reef ecosystems `where` we study reef corals from Bocas del Toro, Caribbean Panama. `what/how ` We chouse this place because here we had the exceptional opportunity to sample reef corals that lived 7 000 yeas ago. Our chance was during construction work, after which that fossil treasure was transformed into a lake and lost forever. Luckily, our samples allow us to compare those communities of pristine reef corals with the the communities that, in the same region, live today.

This project has excellent home and family. Its home is The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, which offers exceptional support including [grants of all sorts](xxxlink). Its family are a bunch of people rich in ideas and energy, and willing to work hard to make this world a better place. We call ourselves the **coral team**: [Nicte-Ha Mu√±oz](xxxlinknicte) (intern, post-graduate student), [Melisa Chan](xxxlinkmelisa) (intern, graduate student), [Felix Rodriguez](xxxlinkfelix) (staff research assistant), [Andrew Altieri](xxxlinkandrew) (co-advisor, staff scientist), [Aaron O'Dea](xxxlinkaaron) (principal investigator, staff scientist) and me, [Mauro Lepore](xxxlinkmauro) (the guy blame, fellow scientist). 

This is looking great! Not let's get the job done! We'll keep you posted!






# Blog 2: Great news from the coral team!

The coral team has gret news to share: one reefs from Bocas del Toro looks similar to pristine! Curious? Here is what we found.

- Achievements:

    + preliminary results
    + reference collection (thank Katie Cramer for material)
    + presented reserach at APANAC, show abstract and photos (thank Kristin for illustrations)






# Blog 3: middle of the story

- Results are final
- A manuscript is being produced
- We plan present the results at the STRI's fellows conference
- Invitation to Berkley to discuss paleoecological data analysis

- Where to from here (people)
    + Nicte got a job in Bocas and submitted her masters thesis
    + Melisa went back to school, full of new skills and ideas
    + Expect to come back t STRI
    
- Where to from here (research)

The elipse continues...who is comming next? What remains unsolved?...
